# OpenMC Data Scripts

This repository contains a collection of scripts for generating and managing
data libraries that are used with OpenMC. The `convert_*.py` scripts convert
existing ACE libraries (such as those produced by LANL) into HDF5 libraries
whereas `generate_*.py` scripts use NJOY to process ENDF files directly.

**Note**: unless you are interested in making a customized library, you can find
pregenerated HDF5 libraries at https://openmc.org.
